						<p>
							The World Wide Web is made up of HTML or <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> documents. Approximately 30 billion documents are "webbed" by <em>hyperlinks</em>. There are three major pieces that make up the web: a user with a computer and a browser that "reads" webpages,the internet (uses HTTP to make and send requests to servers), and servers, computers optimized to host the documents that make up the web.

						HTML - Hypertext Markup Language
					</div>
					<div class="section-meat">			
						<p>
							HTML is made up of four main components: text content (what you can see), markup (creates the "look" of the page), references to other documents (e.g. images and videos), and links to other pages.
						</p>

						Markup - Tags and Elements
					</div>
					<div class="section-meat">
						<p>
							<em>Elements</em> are made up of <em>tags</em> (both opening tags, and closing tags) with content between the tags.  These tags instruct the computer to change the content between them in a particular way (e.g. making text bold or italics). 
						</p>
						<p>
							One type of tag, known as an <em>attribute</em>, can be used to create a link in the text (among other functions). For example: <a href="www.scratchpad.io">Practice HTML Here!</a>  Tags can also be used to insert images onto a page.  Keep in mind that tags create elements that are either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>.  Inline elements are on the line with text while block elements create an "invisible box" around the content.

						Computers are Stupid
					</div>
					<div class="section-meat">
						<p>
							Computers read instructions <em>literally</em>.  For example: if you use a bold opening tag and failed to use a closing tag, the computer would interpret that as you asking for <em>everything</em> after the opening tag to be in bold text.

						Some General Concepts to Remember
					</div>
					<div class="section-meat">
						<p>	
							1 - Webpages are text documents written in HTML and "read" by browsers.
							<br>
							<br>2 - Coding is instructions written in computer language.
							<br>
							<br>3 - Computers are stupid!
							<br>
							<br>4 - Programmers can't remember everything. Don't be afraid to look things up!
							<br>
							<br>5 - Basic HTML vocabulary: <em>tag, element, attribute</em>.

						<p>
 							Whether we are talking about the HTML code itself or the boxes that make up the "structure" of a webpage, <em>everything</em> is layered.

						Indenting: Waves and Trees
					</div>	
					<div class="section-meat">
						<p>
 							Looking at HTML code reveals a wave created by indenting the divisions (read: boxes).  You can visually see how "deep" a box is by its level of indentation.
						</p>
						<p>
							Note:  It's a good idea to create this structure first (even on paper using the "box method") before muddying the water with content.
